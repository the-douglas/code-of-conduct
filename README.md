# Alumni Code of Conduct

Offering a safe and supportive environment is our top priority. We believe feeling safe is essential to
helping people feel comfortable expressing themselves openly and creatively. We aim to cultivate an
environment for authentic interactions by keeping deceptive content and accounts off our platform.
Our values form the foundation of our Community Guidelines. We will address concerns as they arise
and suspend or ban accounts involved in severe or repeated violations.

Our Community Guidelines apply to everyone, and to everything shared on all alumni channels. They
provide general guidance on what is considered permissible and impermissible conduct while using
the platform.

We update our Community Guidelines from time to time to evolve with community behavior, mitigate
emerging risks, and keep all alumni space a safe place for creativity and joy. You are responsible for
reviewing and following these Community Guidelines.

## General Guidelines

- **Speak for yourself**: Unless you are communicating on behalf of us in the performance of your
job, make it clear the views you are expressing are yours and do not necessarily reflect ours.
- **Be Real**: Pseudonyms, alter-egos, and avatars are not permitted to use our platforms. We are
a professional community and require that you participate using your real name at all times.
- **Be respectful**: Treat others with courtesy and respect. Do not publish anything defamatory or
abusive about any activities, policies, or strategies, or toward fellow alumni.
- **Be professional**: Remember that conflicts are typically best resolved by concise
communication or working with the Alumni Director.
- **Respect confidentiality**: Do not publish confidential information about Galvanize or Hack Reactor, and respect the privacy of your fellow alumni.

## Specific Policy

While we hope to _build_ a community of learners through our platforms, we will be forced to remove violators of these guidelines from our alumni community as soon as we’re aware of it.

## Harassment, bullying, and abusive behavior

Our alumni should feel safe to express themselves without fear of being shamed, humiliated, bullied,
or harassed. We deeply understand the psychological distress that abusive content can have on
individuals, and we do not tolerate abusive content or behavior on our platform. We review all
expressions of abuse, including but not limited to violent threats, sexual harassment, disparaging
statements regarding appearance, intellect, personality traits, and hygiene.

Do not post:

- Content that threatens an individual with violence
- Content that wishes death, serious disease, physical, or other harm on an individual
- Content that incites violence or coordinated harassment
- Content that sexually harasses a user by disparaging their sexual activities or attempting to make unwanted sexual contact
- Content that disparages a private individual on the basis of attributes such as intellect, appearance, personality traits, or hygiene
- Content that praises violent tragedies and disparages their victims

## Infringement of others’ privacy

Revealing or threatening to reveal personally identifiable information can cause emotional distress
and lead to harm. We consider it a form of abuse and do not allow it in our community. Do not post:

- Content that reveals or threatens to reveal personally identifiable information, including but
not limited to residential address, private email address, private phone number, bank
statement, social security number, or passport number
- Threats to reveal sexual imagery or non-consensual intimate imagery

## Misleading information

We do not permit misinformation that could cause harm to our community or the larger public. While
we encourage users to have respectful conversations about subjects that matter to them, we review
and address all misinformation that could cause harm to an individual's health or wider public safety.

Do not post:

- Misinformation meant to incite fear, hate, or prejudice
- Misinformation that may cause harm to an individual's health
- Hoaxes, phishing attempts, or manipulated content meant to cause harm

*If you’re unsure whether your post is appropriate, consider whether you would post it at work.*
